A simple interface to RU lexTALE data  
Last update: `r Sys.Date()`

### Overview

Use this package to interface with the `lextale_ru` repo and download data  
from specific terms or courses.

### Installation

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jvcasillas/rult")
```

### Use

Use the `download_lextale_data()` function to get data from the server. 
By default, the function will download a `lextale` folder to the working directory of your R session: 

```{r}
#| label: ex-1
#| eval: false
library("rult")
download_lextale_data()
```

If you would like to download the data to a specific location in your working directory, you can use the `destination` argument: 

```{r}
#| label: ex-2
#| eval: false
library("rult")
download_lextale_data(
  destination = "data"
)
```

You can use the `apply_filter` argument to select a subset of the data on the server. 
For example, if you only want the data from Fall 2023, you would use the following code: 

```{r}
#| label: ex-3
#| eval: false
library("rult")
download_lextale_data(
  destination = "data", 
  apply_filter = "term == 'fa_2023'"
)
```

Note that the term *must* be specified as with "fa", "sp" or "su" following by an underscore, i.e., `_`, and then the year, e.g., "sp_2024", "su_2023", etc. 

It is also possible to filter by course: 

```{r}
#| label: ex-4
#| eval: false
library("rult")
download_lextale_data(
  destination = "data", 
  apply_filter = "course = '940:132 Intermediate Spanish'"
)
```
